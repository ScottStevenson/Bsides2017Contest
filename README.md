# Hack This Smart Contract!

This repo contains a vulnerable contract to accompany my talk at BSides St. John's 2017 (http://bsidesstjohns.com/). 

Deployed contract address: 0x12CE9Ffd87CfC937F7d9314bd307A99B969B4163

The easiest way to interact with the contract is to:
* Download Mist (https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases)
* Click the "Contracts" tab
* Click "Watch Contract"
* Input the contract address and the JSON interface from this repo
* You can then call contract functions directly from Mist

Good luck!
